### Ahoy!
My name is Red and I am a Junior Dev and Scrum Master at Gen City Labs.

I have built games in Unity using C# & built websites using Javascript, HTML and CSS with VS Code.

My hobbies are rock climbing, backpacking and gaming.

Hoping to expand my skills into designing VR/AR apps as well as AI interactive tools.
